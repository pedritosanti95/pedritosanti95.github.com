Instructions
1.  Implement the ASCIIanimation lab described in the attached PDF. 

2. Re-implement the following exercises from Lab 5 to use map/filter/reduce Array methods instead 
of for loops:

if you implemented using Array methods in Lab 5 already, then use loop to do it.

/* 4 Define a function sum() and a function multiply() that sums and multiplies (respectively) 
all the numbers in an array of numbers

/* 5 Define a function reverse() that computes the reversal of a string.

/* 7 Write a function filterLongWords() that takes an array of words and an integer i and returns 
the array of words that are longer than i. */

Post your result at Github pages.  Also write up your interesting points learned and put the link 
to your Github pages solution in Sakai if you want.
